The quiet that fell on the town was startling. Neighbors met on the streets and stared at oneanother, uncertain, uneasy,
</p>
</body></html>
<p>
as to what might be impending. The stillness, after the screaming days,brought no surcease to strained nerves but, if possible,
</p>
</body></html>
<p>
made the strain even worse. No one knewwhy the Yankee batteries were silent; there was no news of the troops except that
</p>
</body></html>
<p>
they had beenwithdrawn in large numbers from the breastworks about the town and had marched off toward thesouth to defen
</p>
</body></html>
<p>
d the railroad. No one knew where the fighting was, if indeed there was any fighting,or how the battle was going if there was a battle.
</p>
</body></html>
<p>
　　Nowadays the only news was that which passed from mouth to mouth. Short of paper, short ofink, short of men,
</p>
</body></html>
<p>
the newspapers had suspended publication after the siege began, and the wildestrumors appeared from nowhere and swept through the town.
</p>
</body></html>
<p>
Now, in the anxious quiet, crowdsstormed General Hood’s headquarters demanding information, crowds massed about the telegraphoffice and the depot hoping for tidings,
</p>
</body></html>
<p>
good tidings, for everyone hoped that the silence ofSherman’s cannon meant that the Yankees were in full retreat and the Confederates chasing themback up

<p>
the road to Dalton, But no news came. The telegraph wires were still, no trains came in onthe one remaining railroad from the south and the mail service was broken.

　　Autumn with its dusty, breathless heat was slipping in to choke the suddenly quiet town, addingits dry, panting weight to tired, anxious hearts. To Scarlett,

<p>
mad to hear from Tara, yet trying tokeep up a brave face, it seemed an eternity since the siege began, seemed as though she had alwayslived with the sound of

</body></html>
<p>
cannon in her ears until this sinister quiet had fallen. And yet, it was onlythirty days since the siege began. Thirty days of siege! The city ringed with

</body></html>
<p>
red-clay rifle pits, themonotonous booming of cannon that never rested, the long lines of ambulances and ox cartsdripping blood down the dusty streets toward the hospitals,
</p>
</body></html>
<p>
the overworked burial squads draggingout men when they were hardly cold and dumping
</p>
</body></html>
<p>
them like so many logs in endless rows ofshallow ditches. Only thirty days!
</p>
</body></html>
<p>
　　And it was only four months since the Yankees moved south from Dalton! Only four months!
</p>
</body></html>
<p>
Scarlett thought, looking back on that far day, that it had occurred in another life. Oh, no! Surelynot just four months. It had been a lifetime.
</p>
</body></html>
<p>
Four months ago! Why, four months ago Dalton, Resaca, Kennesaw Mountain had been to heronly names of places on the railroad. Now they were battles,

</body></html>
<p>
battles desperately, vainly fought as Johnston fell back toward Atlanta. And now, Peachtree Creek, Decatur, Ezra Church and UtoyCreek were no longer

Never names of places any more. Names of graves where friends lay buried, names of tangledunderbrush and thick woods where bodies rotted unburied,

names of the four sides of Atlantawhere Sherman had tried to force his army in and Hood’s men had doggedly beaten him back.
